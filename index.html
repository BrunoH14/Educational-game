                        Contemporary human rights law has important historical predecessors. The value system that is manifested and expressed in human rights is neither a specifically Western one, nor an invention of the 20th century &#45; the belief that every human being is born with certain rights, which allow him/her to live a life in dignity, is rooted in a variety of cultures, religions and early traditions worldwide. The idea of human rights evolved over a long period of time and was written down (&#34;codified&#34;) in several major stages. We will look at some of the major steps in human rights evolution.
                        <br /><br />&#34;One expression of the global value system that forms the basis of human rights is the <span class='goldenWord'>&#34;Golden Rule&#34;</span>: Did you know that the &#34;Golden Rule&#34; can be traced in all major religions around the globe and is an important contribution to the idea of human rights?

                        <span class="quote">&#34;What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.&#34; Confucius</span>
                        <br /><br />
                    <p>Similarly, the African concept of &#34;ubuntu&#34; is based on the idea of what it means to be human, emphasizing respect for all members of the community as well as hospitality and generosity. &#34;A person is a person through other people&#34;. If we are human through others, then dehumanizing another also dehumanizes us, which is why we need to promote and respect the rights of others.</p>

                            For example: &#34;No one of you is a believer until he desires for his brother that which he desires for himself.&#34; (Islam). &#34;Do naught to others which, if done to thee, would cause thee pain: this is the sum of duty.&#34; (Hinduism). &#34;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&#34; (Christianity). &#34;What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man. That is the entire law: all the rest is commentary.&#34; (Judaism). &#34;Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful.&#34; (Buddhism).<br /><br />Most societies had oral or written traditions similar to this &#34;Golden Rule&#34;: for example, the Inca and Aztec codes of conduct and justice and an Iroquois Constitution were Native American sources that existed before the 18th century.

                            <p>In 1215, English nobles and members of the clergy made the King of England agree to abide by the law by drawing up the Great Charter of liberties. However, the Magna Carta protected only the rights of the privileged (nobles) and is not, therefore, about human rights as such.  It is still widely cited in defence of civil liberties because it represented a limitation of the king's power and recognition of (some) individuals' liberties and rights.</p>

                        It took the catalyst of World War II to finally propel human rights onto the global stage and into the global conscience.
                        <br /><br />The atrocities committed in the course of this war &#45; the Holocaust with its more than six million Jewish victims, the persecution of hundreds of thousands of Sinti, Romani, homosexuals, persons with disabilities and other groups who were opposed to the Nazi regime, as well and massive war crimes &#45; finally brought worldwide attention to the need for a universal system for the guarantee and protection of human rights: Never again should anyone be unjustly denied life, freedom, food, shelter, and nationality &#45; calls came from across the globe for human rights standards to protect citizens from abuses by their governments, standards against which states could be held accountable for the treatment of those living within their borders. Never again should anyone be unjustly denied life, freedom, food, shelter, and nationality.
                        <br /><br />Thus, World War II sparked the emergence of a further body of international law and, above all, the creation of human rights as we know them today: States committed themselves to establishing the United Nations, with the primary goal of bolstering international peace and preventing conflict, on a foundation of fundamental human rights, dignity and worth of the human person and on the equal rights between men and women. The UN Charter was adopted in 1945.&#34;
